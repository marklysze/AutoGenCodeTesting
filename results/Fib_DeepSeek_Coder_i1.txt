Sure, here is a simple python program which calculates the nth fibonacci series. Here we are using iterative method for better performance rather than recursive or dynamic programming methods.

```python
def Fibonacci(n): 
    if n<0: 
        print("Incorrect input") 
    elif n==1: 
        return 0
    elif n==2: 
        return 1
    else: 
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(n-2):   # starting from third term till nth term
            fib = a + b
            a, b = b, fib
        return fib
print(Fibonacci(14))
```
This program will print the 14th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers where every number after the first two are the sum of the two preceding ones. Here, we start from 0 and 1 and then keep calculating the next term as the sum of previous two terms. We do this for n-2 times starting from third term till nth term.

The 14th Fibonacci number is indeed `233`. The function you provided calculates the Fibonacci numbers up to a given term by adding the last two terms in each iteration, and then returns the n-th calculated term. In this case, it computes the 14th Fibonacci number.
