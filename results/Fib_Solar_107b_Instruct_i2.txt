code_writer (to code_executor_agent):

To calculate the 14th Fibonacci number, we can write a function using dynamic programming to improve performance. Here's the Python code:

```python
from typing import List

# Dynamic programming based function to find Fibonacci numbers
def fib_dp(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize array of zeros for storing previous fibonacci results
    dp = [0, 1]
    
    if n <= len(dp):
        return dp[n - 1]

    # Iterate till we reach our required index
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp.append(dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])
    
    return dp[-1]

# Call the function to find the 14th Fibonacci number
print("The 14th Fibonacci number is:", fib_dp(14))
```

In this example, we defined a dynamic programming-based function `fib_dp()`, which takes an integer argument `n`. Inside the function, we created an array (list) to store previous Fibonacci results. If the required number is less than or equal to our current array's length, we return its value directly; otherwise, we keep iterating and updating the values in this array till we reach our desired index. Finally, outside of the function, we call `fib_dp(14)` to find the 14th Fibonacci number.
