code_writer (to code_executor_agent):

Sure, for this task you can use `yfinance` library which allows us to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance. Also we will be using `matplotlib` for visualization. Let's install these packages first if they are not installed yet. 
```python
pip install yfinance matplotlib pandas
```
Now, let's get the stocks data:
```python
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from datetime import date

# Define the ticker list
tickers_list = ['TSLA', 'META']

# Set start and end dates
end_date = date.today()
start_date = (end_date.year - 1, end_date.month, end_date.day)

# Fetch the data
data = yf.download(tickers_list,'{}'.format('-'.join(map(str,start_date))),end=end_date)['Adj Close']
```
Now that we have fetched our data, let's plot it:
```python
# Plot the closing prices against time
plt.figure(figsize = (15,7)) 
for c in tickers_list:
    plt.plot(data[c], label=c)
    
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Adjusted Closing Price')
plt.title('YTD Adjusted Close Prices for TSLA and META')
plt.legend()
```
This will plot the adjusted closing prices of TSLA and META for the year to date (starting from January 1st). If you run these blocks, it should produce a graph showing this data. The x-axis is time and the y-axis is the price. There are blue lines for TSLA and green lines for META.

It seems like you have installed some libraries and they are working together as expected. However, I can't see any code in your question to solve a particular problem or execute any piece of code. Please provide the Python code that you want help with so I can assist you properly.
