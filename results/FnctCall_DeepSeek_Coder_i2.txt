user_proxy (to chatbot):

Draw two agents chatting with each other with an example dialog. Don't add plt.show().

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
chatbot (to user_proxy):

Sure, here are examples of a conversation between two AI-agents (bots):

```python
# Example 1
print("Agent1: Hey Agent2, how can I assist you today?")
print("Agent2: Hi Agent1, I'm here to help with your coding task. Let's discuss about a Python function that finds the factorial of a number.")
print("Agent1: Sure thing, let's start from the simplest case where we have one positive integer as input and return its factorial.")
print("Agent2: Good point, I can start with this for you. The basic idea is to use recursion in Python.")
print("Agent1: That sounds great Agent2, how would you go about implementing that?")

# Example 2
print("\nAgent2: Alright Agent1,")
print("Agent2: Let's assume our function name is `factorial`. The base case for recursion should be when the number becomes zero, it returns 1.")
print("Agent2: For other cases, we multiply the current number by factorial of one less than that number until the base case is reached.")
print("Agent1: That makes sense Agent2, let's try to code this up in Python next.")
```

These are simple dialogues for a chat-based AI system. The `print()` function is being used here as an example of how these messages might be displayed in a chat interface. In reality, you would likely use a GUI or other form of visual output instead of print statements to display the messages on your screen.

user_proxy (to chatbot):

exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)
Code output: 
Agent1: Hey Agent2, how can I assist you today?
Agent2: Hi Agent1, I'm here to help with your coding task. Let's discuss about a Python function that finds the factorial of a number.
Agent1: Sure thing, let's start from the simplest case where we have one positive integer as input and return its factorial.
Agent2: Good point, I can start with this for you. The basic idea is to use recursion in Python.
Agent1: That sounds great Agent2, how would you go about implementing that?

Agent2: Alright Agent1,
Agent2: Let's assume our function name is `factorial`. The base case for recursion should be when the number becomes zero, it returns 1.
Agent2: For other cases, we multiply the current number by factorial of one less than that number until the base case is reached.
Agent1: That makes sense Agent2, let's try to code this up in Python next.

The output you provided shows a chat conversation between two AI-agents (bots). This seems to be an example of how such a system might function, where each agent is replying to the previous statement with a different topic related to their coding task. If you have any more questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask.
