We have a wonderful resource to help you here at Raising Homeschoolers! Our new Homeschooling Magazine subscribers get to watch the video that’s linked below, which gives you three ideas for developing a Unit Study with your kids in Grades K-6.
How are your kiddos feeling about school this year? If you’re like us, we have many good feelings and some not so great feelings! We feel like they need more structure and less flexibility. We’ve been dealing with the fact that they will be spending more time at home during the summer months (although that could change as we spend 2 weeks away in our very first homeschooling vacation!) We want to teach them a lot more!
In this episode, we give you three ideas for developing a Unit Study with your kids in Grades K-6. We give you some tips and tricks about how to structure the study so it’s manageable and also fun to do together as a family. This video will show you different ways to approach topics, from more basic to more advanced and everything in between.
There are many books out there that cover these same topics that I mention on our blog at Raising Homeschoolers. But we’ve found this to be the best way for us so far! We like doing them together as a family, so we have our kids help with finding pictures and resources, as well as taking notes and putting them all together in a book. The kids also enjoy being able to work through different levels at their own speed, which is great!
I hope this video gives you some ideas about how to do your grade 3 unit study. Please take time to watch it below if you like to see more about our homeschooling and our curriculum choices for the kids. We would love for you to subscribe to our Homeschooling Magazine, which is where we found this video!
How will YOU plan your grade 3 unit study?
As a subscriber of my blog, you know that I love creating my own units with my homeschooling kiddos. However, there are times when I simply need to find something out there already created in order for us to move forward and get caught up with the school year. Sometimes I just want to pick a unit from someone else’s curriculum.
We love our Splendor of Learning Unit Study Planner! It makes finding great resources and keeping everything organized so much easier, and it is so very affordable for homeschooling families. We can easily buy the book here if you decide that you would like to use their units. But what I really love about their curriculum is that they have such a variety of themes covered in just one book! It’s an excellent resource, and it’s affordable at $14 for the book that includes all 30 units with many different ideas to choose from.
There are some great freebies available online as well…for free! One of our favorite bloggers and resources is Lilly Pad. She has a variety of Unit Study Planners on her site, and there are lots of free ones as well. Her website is here: https://www.lillypadhomeschooling.com/unit-studies. I love the “Fall into History” unit study which covers a lot about Native Americans! And just to let you know…the book is available for only $14.95 if you download it right now from Lilly Pad Homeschooling’s site!
There are also free units for homeschooling families through the book, The 3-6 Teacher’s Handbook by Sharon Bray. They are free at http://www.threeteenshomeschoolteachershandbook.org/unit_studies.html. However…I personally don’t like them because of the way they are structured and how much they are trying to force us into certain beliefs that are not Biblically based. But there is some good content in those free units.
We have had good success using a couple different Unit Study Planners from this Homeschool Review Crew site. You can check out their collection of resources here: http://homeschoolreviewcrew.com/category/unit-study-planning/. There are plenty of free printable worksheets, charts and other information in there that can help you get started!
There are lots of online Unit Study Planners available as well at sites like this one from CCEA (Christian Educational Association). You’ll find tons of great content here: http://www.ccsoc.org/academia. I know that the K-3 Unit Studies are free to download, so you could check them out and see if there is anything in there you can use with your children!
Do YOU have a favorite homeschooling resource? Do you create your own curriculum for your kids or do you pick something that’s already available for purchase? Share all of the information you find to be useful here. Let us know if we should be sharing more than just a couple resources!
In this episode, we are talking about some simple ways to make your homeschooling experience more fun and engaging for both you and your kids! I’ve also made it clear that if you’re using a homeschool curriculum, you can use the things on our blog to help you as well! This is going to be a very practical episode.
It’s been awhile since we’ve done an episode of this podcast in which I talk about some basic ideas and thoughts that have helped us stay sane during our homeschooling adventures with the kids! We share these things, and you can pick whatever ones work for you so you can keep your sanity when doing homeschooling.
There are plenty of ideas here on this blog to help make school more fun for your kiddos. Just search for “homeschool” and see what I’ve written!
We have also been writing some of our favorite posts from the last few months on our blog, which is where you can find all of these tips that will help your homeschooling experience be more fun. Please take a moment to subscribe to my newsletter if you are not already a subscriber, and get those FREE resources sent directly to your inbox!
There are lots of ways to make the kids’ homeschooling experience engaging…and to help keep you sane! I hope some of these tips work for you as well!
Avoid using phrases like, “What is this called?” or “This is supposed to be easy!” You’ll find it hard to avoid using those kinds of comments when you have a difficult child. But we will be teaching them how to do things on their own, not letting them fall back and ask for help every step of the way!
Be sure your homeschooling children know that there is more than one way to accomplish anything, which makes it much easier if they are taught different ways of doing something. They’ll learn this from watching us do things with you! And then they will be able to try something differently themselves and see what works for them…which also helps them grow as a person!
When I hear my kids asking me questions that would lead me to ask “Why is that important?” or “What is the purpose of this?” it usually means there was some sort of conflict or challenge.
As homeschool parents, we need to know how to help our kiddos with conflict and challenges. And I’ve found that a great resource for us has been this Homeschooling magazine! Just click on “subscribe now” at the top right corner of any page here on my blog so you can get all kinds of info from us!
The first book that we bought to help us with our homeschooling kiddos was an excellent one called, “The Teacher’s Pocketbook: A Guide for Parents Who Homeschool”. This book contains some great advice about what you should teach in the different stages of your child’s development. It’s a great resource!
But here’s my tip…the first time we read this book, it was because of how good it was written! We had our own homeschooling plan up to that point and I knew it could be improved upon! Then I found out that the book contained information about what should be taught based on your child’s developmental stage. It was an excellent tool for us, and we have continued to use it even now as a resource in our homeschooling adventures with the kids!
And this is not my only recommendation. You can get so many good books from homeschooling families…and there are lots of resources available online as well if you search for “homeschool” or something similar to that. And remember, you can always find those resources on our blog, Raising Homeschoolers!
We all know that sometimes the homeschooling experience is not always the easiest or most fun. Sometimes we get stuck in the middle of a mess and the kids have no clue what they’re supposed to do…and neither does Mommy! However, if you are like us, we can help our children learn some skills that will keep them moving forward during difficult situations, so there is hope for our homeschooling adventures.
We use “The Teacher’s Pocketbook: A Guide for Parents Who Homeschool” every time we get stuck! This book helps us to figure out what stage of development our child is in at that particular moment. It also provides suggestions for how we can teach them some skills so they are able to handle things on their own from there.
Sometimes it’s hard for us homeschool parents to find time during the day to go through our homeschooling plans with the kids! We usually just rush them along and make sure we have taught what should be covered each day of school. But that is not always the best thing! Our kiddos need some structure in order to grow into adults, and they can learn a lot from us if we do things right!
We started doing something that I call “Homeschooling Monday.” We would start the week out by sitting down with all of our homeschooling plans for the month. Then we’d go through each day to see what we should teach them on each particular day, and why. This way, when it comes time to do the things with our kids at home during the school year, we already know exactly what they will need to learn.
We are also reading a book called “The Teacher’s Pocketbook: A Guide for Parents Who Homeschool” as well! This is an excellent resource for us…and you can get it here if you’d like! Just search for, “homeschooling” or similar, and the book will come right up.
When we find ourselves with a difficult situation in our homeschooling adventure, we usually just let Mommy handle things! We do know that this is not the best thing to do. But that’s because of all the good resources we have to learn how to help our kids through difficult situations.
For example, you can find several books and articles written by homeschooling parents who have experienced many different things with their children…and they usually know what to do about it! I recommend you read one of these books, or find an article written by a homeschool family online. We have lots of information in our newsletters sent out each month that is helpful for us as well!
Just recently, I heard a podcast episode from The Homeschool Coach. It was called “How to Handle Difficult Situations with Kids”. In this show, you get all the details you need to help your children cope better during difficult situations. You can also find more information about it by clicking on our advertisement for that podcast episode…which is in this blog post!
We try and stay ahead of things and let our kiddos know what’s going on. Then we have lots of great homeschooling resources to help us deal with difficult situations. I can’t even begin to tell you how many of these things are available right here online! You could be listening to a podcast about homeschooling that is just as good as anything you could read from a book if it were written by a family who has experience dealing with our kiddos’ situations…and then it would be on the Internet in an episode of this show.
We have had several different experiences where we needed to let the kids know what was going on and what they should expect when things are difficult for them. The most recent one is that my husband has been on the road all week working with other homeschooling parents around the country…and he just came back home!
But here’s how we made sure our kids knew that they would be moving to a new place at the end of the school year! They were already planning for that in their minds, and it helped them focus on what they need to accomplish. We did not have to go into details about when this will happen…which I’m so glad we didn’t because things can get really messy with our kids during times like these!
We’ve talked before about how important it is for your homeschooling children to know exactly what you expect of them. Then they can plan in their own minds what they will be able to do in order to make sure they can meet those expectations.
In this case, we had been teaching the kiddos all year long to work hard at school and study…and then when school is over for the summer, they will move into a different place and work very hard to learn more things! They know that during their summer time with us, they can expect to do lots of reading or some other type of learning.
Then we’ll move on through the year at our new homeschooling adventure together as well. This is also something that we talked about before…that their school work will not be done for them during those times, and that they will be working very hard in order to learn all kinds of things! They know what we expect from them, so they can plan on meeting those expectations!
We have several different ways to let the kids know exactly what you expect of them…and one way is through the use of homeschooling plans. These are usually written out each month in a little book that I refer to as our “school planner.” They also write their own little school plans for themselves on their little homeschooling calendar.
When we need to let our kids know exactly what they can expect from us, we always talk about these homeschooling plans and how we will be teaching them things that are important each month. Then the kids can plan in advance what their school work should look like. It’s a way of setting the stage for the times ahead to come!
I am not sure if this is the best way for us to do things, but I think it helps our kiddos understand that we are moving on from one place to another during the summer months. We usually make sure they know as much about what’s going on at their new homeschooling adventure with us in advance so that nothing comes as a surprise for them.
We just finished up our last month of school together, and we are now planning ahead for this next month! But it seems like everything is coming back to me all of a sudden, because I have to write about it for this post! You’ll find out what it’s like for us homeschooling parents in just a few minutes.
We had our final school night with our kids at the beginning of May. Then we took them down to the basement to work on their math and science projects. This was when we learned that one of our kiddos had made his science project so big, that it didn’t fit into our tiny storage space down there! So he decided to make it even bigger than before…and I found out that it doesn’t even fit in the back seat of his car either!
That is when we learned that he still needs to work hard at school to try and make sure he can understand and apply all of what they are learning. He just had one more thing that needed to get finished before he could move onto the next level! We did talk about this with him, so that he would know that he wasn’t doing any better than the other kids at school were.
We are now planning ahead for our summer months and what we can expect during those times to come in advance so that nothing comes as a surprise for us! Then after school starts back again in the fall, you will find out what it is like for us homeschooling parents then…because I have to write about it for this post!
We are now working on our homeschooling plans for this upcoming month, and we are very excited. This has been a busy school year for us homeschool parents as well! It seems that everything just gets harder when school starts again after the summer months! But you’ll find out what it is like to work on these plans in just a few minutes.
We had our last monthly meeting with all of our homeschooling kids at the beginning of May. Then we spent time together as a family working on math and science projects for our kids who are at school right now. One little boy learned about his big problem right then, when he decided to try and do even better than what he had been doing!
We found out that he still needed to work hard at school in order to apply all of the things they learn each month to himself. He just learned one more thing before he could move onto the next level with his math and science projects, but we told him that we were glad for that because it shows that he has been paying attention and trying!
We are now working on our homeschooling plans for this upcoming month…and we have lots of exciting things in store for us all right now! Then after school starts back again next fall, you’ll find out what it is like to work with our children then! But I have to write about these homeschooling plans for this post before that happens.
I am sure that many people who are homeschooling their kids will be very interested in the type of things we do during those times when school starts back again after the summer months. This is because it gets harder each month as school goes on for our children! You’ll find out what it is like to work with our homeschooling children in just a few minutes.
We have had our last meeting together as a family working on our kids’ math and science projects before summer started up at the beginning of May. Then we got ready to head down into the basement for another school night together, but we had one more thing that needed to get done first! We found out what it was like to work with our homeschooling children in just a few minutes!
We spent time working on all kinds of projects, but we also talked about how hard things will be for the kids at school next month. This is because they are starting back into a new level and they have no idea what is ahead for them in that classroom! One little girl decided to do even better than she had been doing before, so she made her project even bigger!
We talked to her about what was happening with her project at school and why it wasn’t going as well as it had before. She just needed to work hard at school one more month in order to try and figure out all of the things they are learning there! So we told her that she should be proud, because it shows that she is paying attention and trying to learn! Then we headed down into the basement for our last school night together before summer started up.
Then after school starts back again next fall, you’ll find out what it is like to work with our homeschooling children then! But I have to write about these kids in just a few minutes before that happens. You will find out all kinds of things as we plan ahead for the coming months.
We are now getting ready to take down our school plans from the wall and start working on them again at our next monthly meeting with all of our homeschooling children! That’s because the school year is starting back up again after this summer starts up…and it will get harder each time we have a new school day. But you will find out what it is like to work with our children in just a few minutes before that happens.
We spent one more night working on our kids’ math and science projects at the end of May. Then we put everything away, and headed home for the weekend. We were now ready for another school year! One little girl learned about her big problem right then, when she decided to try and do even better than what she had been doing before!
We found out that she still needed to work hard at school in order to apply all of the things they learn there to herself. She just made one more thing for her science project before she could move onto the next level…but we told her it was a good thing because it shows that she is paying attention and trying!
We are now working on our homeschooling plans for this upcoming month, as well as preparing to take them down from the wall and start working on them again. We are very excited about what is in store for us over the next several months ahead! But after school starts back again next fall, you will find out all kinds of things that we are getting ready to do now.

We talked about how hard school is going to be when it starts back up again in the fall for our children who are at school right now. It seems that they will start on a brand new level when they go back there next month…and none of them know what to expect then! She just needed one more thing before she could move onto the next level with her math and science projects, but we told her it was okay because it shows that she is paying attention and trying to learn all kinds of things for herself.
You will find out a lot of things about how we work together as homeschooling parents then!
