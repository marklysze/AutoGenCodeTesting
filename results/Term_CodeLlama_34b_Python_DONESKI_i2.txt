Come up with 3 story ideas for Grade 3 kids.

A great place to begin is by going through the books you already have, either from your own library or from the school library. As a teacher, I don’t think it would be appropriate to buy new books just so you can write lesson plans based on them; but if you find some that you really like you may want to buy more for your classroom library.
Then take time to read each book with an eye toward writing a story idea that uses the same theme. For example, if there is a picture in one of the books about a boy who eats his vegetables and then spits them out because he didn’t like the taste, then you could write a story about what would happen if he was on a roller coaster and his hat flew off his head.
Here are two books I’ve used to help my class with this writing exercise. The first is called Flip Out! by Chris Raschka and is an awesome book. It tells the story of a boy who is really scared of going up roller coasters, but he goes anyway. While they are up there in the sky, his hat blows off, and suddenly he begins to flip out!
In the second story, the class discovered that it was fun to be upside down on a roller coaster as long as the seats don’t touch the floor.
You could also read a book like the classic I Am Sam by Audrey Patterson. In this story a boy named Sam has severe cerebral palsy. His legs are not able to move, but he is very strong. The book follows Sam as he tries different things and learns how to walk.
You could take your class through the process of coming up with ideas and help them to write their own story ideas for roller coasters using this theme. Here’s a worksheet that may help you do that. It is very simple, but it can help you organize your thoughts before you begin writing about any subject in your lesson plans.

A great place to go from here would be the online world. The Internet has so many resources for kids who are learning how to read and write that you could spend a whole year on this topic alone! There are some great roller coasters with lots of pictures to help students learn more about roller coasters, or they can even design their own roller coaster.
A roller coaster is a very fun idea for any time of the year. If you combine it with another theme, you may be able to come up with some other ideas as well. Here are some links to other resources that I think your students would enjoy and will help you get them excited about writing.
Here’s one roller coaster that a kid designed using the online program KidPix.
These kids used Kidpix to create a roller coaster picture, and then wrote a story based on it. They also made a narration of their story which you can see here. You may want to look at the instructions for writing a story before trying this exercise with your students. It would be great if they could use Kidpix or one of these programs to help them tell you more about what they’re writing in class.
And lastly, here is a really cute roller coaster picture created by a student. I think it will give you some idea how simple these creations can be.

A lot of my students have used this program for many other ideas as well, and if your kids are old enough, they may want to learn about it too!
