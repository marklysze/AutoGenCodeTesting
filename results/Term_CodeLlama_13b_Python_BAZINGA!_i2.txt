The interactive sessions include creative exercises that are designed to build children’s critical thinking skills, their capacity for visualising ideas, and their problem solving abilities.
Exercises allow children to bring out their creative potential and think of new and original stories. They then read these aloud to the audience who listen attentively. The interactive sessions are designed around different themes such as the weather, animals, science and more.
Storytelling is an invaluable tool for learning language. Children use storytelling to share stories about their lives with friends and family and it can also be used to teach language skills.
Learn from your child’s imagination!
Exciting stories will make your children laugh, cry and want to hear more!
This fun session is designed for pre-school and kindergarten age kids, but there are no age restrictions for participation. Come along with your child and join us in a story telling journey together.
In this session we use the art of storytelling to develop language skills and critical thinking skills at the same time. Stories allow children to share experiences from their lives through a well-structured, meaningful narrative which is enhanced by the use of visuals. We make sure that your child has the opportunity to practice his/her vocabulary and listening skills.
In addition to these practical exercises, we will explore different themes such as: weather, animals, science, history, mythology, etc. During this session, your child will experience new and exciting stories based on these topics which are interesting and entertaining for young children.
