 First, let's import the `math` library which contains the necessary functions to compute the 14th Fibonacci number.

```python
import math
```

Next, we define a function called `fibonacci` that takes in an argument `n` and returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number using the closed form expression of the Fibonacci sequence. This is more efficient than using recursion or iteration.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    sqrt_5 = math.sqrt(5)
    phi = (1 + sqrt_5) / 2
    psi = (1 - sqrt_5) / 2
    return int((phi**n - psi**n) / sqrt_5)
```

Finally, we call the `fibonacci` function with an input of 14 to compute and print out the 14th Fibonacci number.

```python
print(fibonacci(14))
```

This will output:

```
377
```

 It seems like you've already written the Python code to calculate the 14th Fibonacci number using the closed form expression of the Fibonacci sequence. Your code is correct and well-structured, leveraging the statefulness of the kernel by defining a function to compute the n-th Fibonacci number and then calling it with an input of 14. The output of your code is indeed the 14th Fibonacci number, 377.

Just as a suggestion, you might want to consider adding comments to your code to improve readability for others who may be less familiar with the closed form expression of the Fibonacci sequence or the reasoning behind using this method.
```python
import math

# This function calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using the closed form expression
def fibonacci(n):
    sqrt_5 = math.sqrt(5)  # square root of 5
    phi = (1 + sqrt_5) / 2  # golden ratio
    psi = (1 - sqrt_5) / 2  # negative inverse of the golden ratio
    return int((phi**n - psi**n) / sqrt_5)  # calculate n-th Fibonacci number

# Compute and print out the 14th Fibonacci number
print(fibonacci(14))
```
This will output:

```
377
```exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)
Code output:

377
