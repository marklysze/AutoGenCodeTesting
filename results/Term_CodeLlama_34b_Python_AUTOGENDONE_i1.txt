 Use one of these ideas or come up with your own!
A day at the beach is fun!
On the first day of summer, everyone is excited about going to the beach! There are lots of waves, and it's cool in the water, but then a shark bites someone on the leg. What should you do?
The students go out into the hallway, and pretend they are at the beach. The teacher starts to tell them how to swim without getting hurt by sharks. Then she gives instructions that they follow with their classmates.
When we get there, there's sand everywhere! Who can find a sandcastle first? Who has the best castle?
Everyone gets into groups of 4-5 students. They start digging holes in the sand to make castles. One student at a time puts some sand into their bucket. If they have more than 2 cups, they lose a piece of sand castle and have to go get more! The group that has the best looking castle after everyone is done gets to eat their lunch together first.
The students go outside and play in the grass or on the sidewalk for a few minutes before sitting down. Then, the teacher reads "All Done" by Eric Carle (see above). Have the students close their eyes and imagine they are done with school for the day. Talk about what you like best about school.
The teacher can use a dry erase board or paper to write down each student's name. When it is someone's turn, they say "I'm done!" The first person finishes gets to go outside and play. The second person says, "I'm done! I am so tired of school!" The teacher can put a dot beside that student's name.
If the students are finished with their work, they can just close their books and sit quietly for the rest of the time. The teacher goes around and reads to each group. Then when it is someone's turn, they can say "I am done! I have no homework tonight!" If that student has been a really good student all week, you could let them go play outside and bring back some flowers or something special that you picked up on the way home from school.
A day in the woods is always exciting!
The students sit down at their desks with pencils and paper to make their own woodland storybook. The teacher can draw pictures of animals, bugs, trees, etc., as a guide. Have each student color a picture in one corner of the page. They will write what they see on another page.
Have students sit down at desks or on carpets. One by one, each student has to do 10 sit ups. When they are done, they can get out and have some fun!
The class goes outside or inside and starts jumping rope. When the teacher is ready, she will count off with a timer: "One, two, three, four." The students repeat it until their classmates are finished. They start a new game if one child gets all of his/her sit-ups done first!
The students can sit down at desks and make pictures of food. When they are done, they can eat it! If you want to make it even more fun, you could have the children draw the food that they like the most or something unusual like a pickle or salad.
The teacher tells each student to try one bite of something yummy at his/her desk. They might be able to guess what they are eating before their turn comes up! Have them think about why they liked their last meal and what foods they would want to try for their next lunch.

The students sit down at the tables and use small plastic spoons to eat some yummy ice cream. If you don't have any, make a big cup of marshmallow fluff and put it in a bowl. Make sure you add sprinkles or mini chocolate chips so that they can try them on their dessert!
Have students sit down at tables with sponges, cups, and some powdered sugar to make their own ice cream sundaes. Then they can eat their ice creams at the end of class time. If you don't have any powdered sugar or ice cream, just use mini marshmallows instead!
The students sit down in chairs and hold a spoon with the tip of their index finger. When the teacher says, "Go!", they all have to eat one bite of whatever is in front of them without using their hands! When it's your turn, you have to try something that you don't like or something that is hard to eat!
The class sits down at desks with a spoon and some food. One by one the teacher will count off: "One, two, three." The students get a bite of whatever is in front of them. If they eat something that they don't like, they have to wash their mouth out!
Have the students sit down at desks or on carpets and put candy or snacks into their pockets. Then one student says "I'm done! I can't wait until my break!" That student gets to go outside for a few minutes and eat all of his/her snacks.
Have each student sit down at tables with pencil and paper, then talk about their favorite foods. They write them on the top of the page. After they finish, you can read the list aloud as a class. If you want to make it even more fun, you could have the children draw what some of their favorite things are!
The class goes outside and sits down for snack time. The teacher hands out little bags with sandwiches or candy in them to each student. They can eat their lunch while they listen to a story that the teacher reads aloud. When it is everyone's turn, you could let one child go up and be the lunch lady and serve everyone some real food!
Have students sit down at desks with pencils and paper and make pictures of all sorts of fruit. Then each student gets to taste a piece of their favorite kind of fruit! You can use marshmallows or fruit snacks as a substitute if you don't have any real fruit.
The teacher sits in front of the class with pencil and paper, then writes down the first few words of a story: "Once upon a time...." One student takes turns guessing what it might be about. If the student gets it right, he/she can pick up all of the papers from the students who have guessed wrong.
Have students sit down at desks and write down their favorite things to do for their birthday. Then, they go outside and each has his or her own party! They can decorate with streamers and balloons, and play some music if there is a piano available. The teacher goes around with cake and ice cream, but the students have to serve themselves. If you don't have enough cake and ice cream for each student, you could just let them eat any dessert that they like!
Have the class sit down at tables with pencils and paper, then talk about what kind of animals there are. Have them write one or two words on their papers so that everyone knows what they should be writing down. When it is their turn, have each student name an animal or write a story about them! You can also let each student draw an animal if you want to make it even more fun.
The class goes outside and sits in a big circle. The teacher has all of the students close their eyes. Then she says something that is true for everyone, like "My ears are at the top of my head." When they open their eyes, they must do something that shows what she said is true! The class can sit down and make up silly rules for one another to follow.
