Today is 2024-03-01. Write Python code to plot TSLA's and META's stock prices YTD.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

code_writer (to code_executor_agent):

To begin, we need to import the necessary libraries for plotting stock prices. We will use `pandas` and `plotly` with their `offline` mode to avoid any internet dependencies. Since you mentioned a stateful IPython kernel, I will assume that once installed, these packages will be available for subsequent code blocks.

```python
# Import libraries for plotting
import pandas as pd
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot
init_notebook_mode(connected=True)
```

Now, we need to fetch the stock price data. For this example, I will use Yahoo Finance's API to get the daily closing prices for TSLA and META stocks from the beginning of the year (2024-01-01) until today (2024-03-01). Please note that you might need to install the `yfinance` library if it's not already installed:

```python
# Pip install yfinance if necessary
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install yfinance[data]  # This is a raw system command in Jupyter notebook syntax, run only if you need to install the package

# Import yfinance for stock data fetching
from yahoo_fin import stock_info as si
```

Now, let's get the stock price data:

```python
# Define tickers and date range
tsla_ticker = 'TSLA'
meta_ticker = 'META'
start_date = '2024-01-01'
end_date = '2024-03-01'

# Fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance
tsla_df = si.get_data(tsla_ticker, start_date, end_date)
meta_df = si.get_data(meta_ticker, start_date, end_date)
```

Next, we will concatenate the dataframes and plot them on a single graph:

```python
# Concatenate dataframes
stocks_df = pd.concat([tsla_df, meta_df], axis=1, join='inner')  # Join on dates to ensure no missing data points

# Plot the stock prices
fig = go.Figure()
for ticker in stocks_df.columns:
    trace = go.Scatter(x=stocks_df.index, y=stocks_df[ticker], name=ticker)  # Create a scatter trace for each ticker
    fig.add_trace(trace)

# Add title and labels to the plot
fig.update_layout(title='YTD Stock Price Performance of TSLA and META', xaxis_title='Date', yaxis_title='Closing Price')
iplot(fig)  # Render the plot in the notebook
```

Please execute this code block to generate the plot. The `iplot` function renders the chart within the Jupyter notebook or any other environment that supports Plotly. If you encounter any issues with library installations or data fetching, please make sure to install the necessary packages and handle any potential errors accordingly.

code_writer (to code_executor_agent):

It appears that there is an error in the code output provided. The `ModuleNotFoundError` indicates that the `yahoo_fin` module could not be found. This module is required for fetching stock data from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` package. It seems like the `yfinance` library has not been installed correctly, or it's not being imported correctly.

Here are a few steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Install yfinance**: If you haven't already installed `yfinance`, run the following command in your Jupyter notebook cell to install it:
```python
!pip install yfinance[data]
```
   Remember that the `!` prefix is used to execute a raw system command within the notebook.

2. **Import yfinance**: Make sure you are importing `yfinance` correctly. The correct import statement should be:
```python
import yfinance as yf
```

3. **Fetch stock data**: Use the `yfinance` API to fetch the stock price data for TSLA and META. For example, instead of using the `si.get_data` function from an undefined module, you should use:
```python
tsla_df = yf.Ticker("TSLA").history(start=start_date, end=end_date)
meta_df = yf.Ticker("META").history(start=start_date, end=end_date)
```

Please execute the corrected code blocks to generate the plot without any errors.

code_writer (to code_executor_agent):

The error message indicates that the variable `start_date` is not defined within the scope of the code. The `history()` method in the `yfinance` library requires a start date to fetch historical stock data. You need to define the `start_date` and `end_date` variables before using them with the `history()` method.

Here's how you can define these variables:

```python
# Define date range
start_date = '2024-01-01'  # This is an example start date, replace it with your desired start date
end_date = '2024-03-01'   # This is an example end date, replace it with your desired end date
```

Once you have defined these variables, you can use them in the `history()` method to fetch the stock price data:

```python
# Fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance using yfinance
tsla_df = yf.Ticker("TSLA").history(start=start_date, end=end_date)
meta_df = yf.Ticker("META").history(start=start_date, end=end_date)
```

Make sure to replace `'2024-01-01'` and `'2024-03-01'` with the actual start and end dates you want to use for your data fetching.

It seems like the code execution has succeeded, but no specific output is provided or expected in this case. When working with stock market data, the primary output would be the resulting `DataFrame` containing the historical stock prices for the specified tickers and dates. However, since you are using an interactive environment (such as a Jupyter notebook), you can directly visualize the data by plotting it within your session.

If you want to plot the data, you can use the previously provided code blocks that use `plotly` to create a line chart comparing the stock prices of TSLA and META. Here's the relevant code again:

```python
# Define date range (if not already done)
start_date = '2024-01-01'  # Replace with actual start date
end_date = '2024-03-01'   # Replace with actual end date

# Fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance using yfinance
tsla_df = yf.Ticker("TSLA").history(start=start_date, end=end_date)
meta_df = yf.Ticker("META").history(start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Plot the stock prices
fig = go.Figure()
for ticker in [tsla_df, meta_df]:
    trace = go.Scatter(x=ticker.index, y=ticker['Close'], name=ticker.name)  # Create a scatter trace for each ticker
    fig.add_trace(trace)

# Add title and labels to the plot
fig.update_layout(title='YTD Stock Price Performance of TSLA and META', xaxis_title='Date', yaxis_title='Closing Price')
iplot(fig)  # Render the plot in the notebook
```

After executing this code block, you should see a plotly chart displaying the YTD stock price performance of TSLA and META within your Jupyter notebook or any other environment that supports interactive Plotly graphs. If you are working with static output (like HTML), the `iplot` function might not work, and you would need to use `fig.write_html()` to save the chart as an HTML file.

If you're using a console-based terminal or a non-interactive environment, the `print()` statement can be used to display the dataframe in a readable format:

```python
print(tsla_df)
print(meta_df)
```

However, this will only show the head of each DataFrame (the first few rows), and it's not recommended for large datasets. For more information on how to work with and display dataframes in different scenarios, refer to the `pandas` documentation.
