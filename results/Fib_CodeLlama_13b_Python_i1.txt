For those who don’t know, Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers where every number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
The first two Fibonacci numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1;
the next one is 1, because 0+1=1;
then 1+1=2, and so on… The important thing to understand here is that you’ll always add up two previous numbers, starting from 0+1 = 1, then 1+1 = 2, then 1+2 = 3, and so on.

The Fibonacci numbers are thus: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5…
Note: we’re starting this sequence at 0 (as 0 is the first number of this sequence), while many people start it from 1 (as 1 is the second number); in either case, you will be asked to compute a Fibonacci number that is not 0th.
For example: the 4th Fibonacci number is 2 because 0+1=1; 0+1+1=2 (the sum of the two first previous ones).
In Python, you can use this piece of code to find a specific Fibonacci number.
