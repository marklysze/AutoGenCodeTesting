Write Python code to calculate the 14th Fibonacci number.

code_writer (to code_executor_agent):

 We can use a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number in Python. The first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is found by adding up the previous two numbers. Let's calculate the 14th Fibonacci number as an example:

```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

fib_number = fib(14)  # Calculate the 14th Fibonacci number
print(fib_number)     # Print the result
```

Running this code gives us the value of the 14th Fibonacci number as an output.
