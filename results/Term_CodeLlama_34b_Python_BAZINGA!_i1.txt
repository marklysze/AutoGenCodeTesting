Students love to read, but when they come upon a story that seems too complicated or difficult, it can be very frustrating. But, this is all avoidable if you teach them how to break down a story into its three essential parts and help them understand the concepts behind the story itself. The whole idea of breaking a story into parts may seem quite confusing, but, in actuality, it’s really rather simple and straightforward. So let us help you do this with your students at school, as well as helping you come up with three different stories for Grade 3 kids.
The first thing to consider is that most stories are broken down into two parts; a story’s beginning, also known as the introduction and its ending, which is called the conclusion. These two parts of the story need not be long or complicated in any way. In fact, if you have a good story and a decent understanding of your target audience, you can make do with just a few words to begin and end your tale. The middle part of the story is also very important; this is called the body of the story, which means that this part covers most of the story’s actual events.
There are several things you need to understand if you want to come up with 3 stories for Grade 3 kids. First of all, make sure your stories have a clear introduction and conclusion as well as a body full of compelling and interesting details. In other words, if you’re going to tell an adventure story to children, don’t leave anything out; write in the details that will make them want to read on, such as a cool castaway island or dangerous cliff. Your students should be able to comprehend what is happening and they should have an idea of how the story will end by the time you get through with the body of your tale.
Most stories are easy enough for young children to understand, but this doesn’t mean that they don’t need some work in understanding them. Teachers need to do their best to teach students about the three parts of a story and how to come up with stories for Grade 3 kids, because if not, their students will most likely be very frustrated when it comes to reading any story that is too complex or difficult to understand.

One great way of teaching Grade 3 children all about stories is to have them break down a simple tale and write three new ones on their own. This is an excellent idea for teachers because it allows kids to think creatively and come up with fresh ideas, which can make learning fun, exciting and even interesting for them.

 The best way to do this is through interactive games that children will find very engaging to play and enjoy as they get older.
To help you teach your students the three essential parts of a story, we have come up with three examples of simple stories which are easy enough for your kids to understand but still entertaining in every sense of the word. The following 3 ideas for Grade 3 kids can be easily adapted by you into more complex tales that are appropriate to the level of education for your students.
The first idea is an exciting story that involves a lost treasure and some hidden clues which will guide our hero along his quest. You could also add in a little bit of suspense for your Grade 3 kids to enjoy this story even more, like the presence of a few scary goblins or zombies, for instance. The idea is that you have to help the princess retrieve the lost treasure from the witch’s tower, which is quite difficult but not impossible as long as you keep following the clues and making wise decisions along the way.
The second story has to do with an adventure in space where your hero will meet aliens who are just as friendly and welcoming as the people on earth. Your Grade 3 kids will be thrilled to learn all about how they could become astronauts themselves in this fascinating tale. The main character in our story is a young boy whose parents are both explorers and have decided to take him with them on an adventure of their own.
The third idea for a Grade 3 kid’s story involves the hero, a young girl who wants to be a princess but finds herself on an adventure that leads her through the jungle towards some dangerous cliffs and even to a castle where she is about to meet the most handsome prince in all the land. The story will teach your kids how to deal with any kind of problems as well as learn how to face their fears, just like our hero does in this tale.
We hope you enjoyed our suggestions for 3 ideas for Grade 3 kids and found them to be easy enough to use for all ages but still engaging enough that your children will have fun reading and enjoying the adventure they take part in while learning more about the three parts of a story.
