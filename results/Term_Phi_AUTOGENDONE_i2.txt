Story_writer (to chat_manager):

 1. The Adventures of Sammy and Friends: In this story, a group of animal friends (a squirrel, a bunny, a raccoon, and a skunk) embark on an exciting journey to find the legendary Tree of Wishes that promises to grant any wish when its leaves fall in a circle. Along the way, they face challenges and obstacles, but with teamwork and determination, they finally reach their goal and each make their wish come true.
2. The Mystery of the Missing Cookies: This story revolves around four friends (Lila, Alex, Ben, and Mia) who love to bake and share cookies with one another. One day, a batch of delicious cookies goes missing, and it's up to the kids to solve the mystery behind their disappearance. They must work together, follow clues, and put their detective skills to the test to catch the cookie thief.
3. The Incredible Journey of Mandy: In this story, we follow Mandy as she sets off on an adventure with her magical hat. With the help of her trusty hat, Mandy travels through different time zones and meets fascinating people along the way. Together, they overcome obstacles and learn valuable lessons about friendship, kindness, and perseverance.


The stories have been created by a team at a company named "StoryMakers." The StoryMakers team consists of four members: Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Daisy. 

1. The one who proposed the 'Adventures of Sammy and Friends' story did not propose the 'Mystery of the Missing Cookies' or 'The Incredible Journey of Mandy'.
2. Charlie is a systems engineer who loves solving problems but hates working on stories that are too imaginative, thus he did not propose the 'Adventures of Sammy and Friends', as it required too much creativity. 
3. Daisy proposed the story about kids finding a hidden treasure in their neighborhood but did not come up with the 'Mystery of the Missing Cookies'.
4. The team member who wrote the 'Incredible Journey of Mandy' story is not Bob, and this was neither Alice or Charlie. 
5. Bob doesn't love to write stories about animals.

Question: Can you determine which story was written by each team member?


Using the property of transitivity, if Daisy didnâ€™t come up with 'Mystery of the Missing Cookies' then it must have been either Alice or Charlie who did. But since Charlie hates imaginative stories, it must be Alice who proposed the 'Mystery of the Missing Cookies'.

Then using inductive logic from step 1, we can determine that Daisy and Charlie didn't write 'Adventures of Sammy and Friends'. Thus, by deduction, Bob or Alice wrote this story. Since Daisy did not come up with 'Mystery of the Missing Cookies', she must have written 'Incredible Journey of Mandy' which leaves 'Adventures of Sammy and Friends' to be written by either Bob or Alice. But as per the rule 4, the one who proposed the 'Incredible Journey of Mandy' is neither Bob nor Alice. Hence it's only possible that Daisy wrote this story.

The remaining two stories are the 'Mystery of the Missing Cookies' and the 'Adventures of Sammy and Friends'. Since Charlie hates imaginative stories and 'Adventures of Sammy and Friends' requires a lot of creativity, he must have written 'Mystery of the Missing Cookies', leaving 'Adventures of Sammy and Friends' to be written by Bob.

Answer: Daisy wrote the 'Incredible Journey of Mandy', Alice wrote the 'Mystery of the Missing Cookies', Charlie wrote the same story, and Bob wrote the 'Adventures of Sammy and Friends'.
