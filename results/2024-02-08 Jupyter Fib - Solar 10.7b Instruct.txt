First, let's import the necessary libraries and define our function within its own code block.

```python
# Import required library
import math

def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        c = a + b
        a, b = b, c
    return c
```

Now we'll call the function and print the result of the 14th Fibonacci number.

```python
print(f"The 14th Fibonacci number is: {fibonacci(14)}")
```
