This Python code defines a function, `fib(n)`, that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. That means the first four Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2.

The `fib(n)` function uses a loop to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. It starts with `a` as 0 and `b` as 1, then iteratively updates `a` and `b` for `n-2` times. After the loop ends, it returns `b`.

In this code, we call `fib(n)` with an input of 14 to calculate the 14th Fibonacci number, store it in the variable `fib_14`, and print it out.

The output for this specific case is "233", which is the 14th Fibonacci number.
