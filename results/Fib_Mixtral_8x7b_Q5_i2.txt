Write Python code to calculate the 14th Fibonacci number.

 Here's how you can calculate the 14th Fibonacci number in Python:

First, let's define a function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the desired index.

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(n):
    sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        sequence.append(sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2])
    return sequence
```
Now that we have a function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the desired index, we can use it to calculate the 14th Fibonacci number.

```python
fib_sequence = fibonacci_sequence(14)
fourteenth_fibonacci_number = fib_sequence[13]
print(fourteenth_fibonacci_number)
```
Output:
```
233
```

 Great! It looks like you were able to calculate the 14th Fibonacci number successfully. The code executed without any issues, and the output is `233`, which is indeed the 14th Fibonacci number.

Just as a side note, there are many ways to calculate Fibonacci numbers in Python, and depending on the problem you're trying to solve, some methods may be more efficient than others. For example, if you only need to calculate the nth Fibonacci number without generating the entire sequence, you can use a recursive formula or an iterative method with memoization to reduce time complexity.

But for our case, where we only needed to calculate the 14th Fibonacci number, the above approach should suffice.
