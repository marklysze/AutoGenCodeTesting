 First, let's define a function to compute Fibonacci numbers recursively. This isn't the most efficient implementation for large inputs, but it will work fine for calculating the 14th Fibonacci number.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

Now, we can calculate the 14th Fibonacci number by calling this function.

```python
fib_14 = fibonacci(14)
print(fib_14)
```

You should see the output `377`.

 First, let's import the required library `math` which contains a method for finding the square root of a number. We will use this to calculate the Golden Ratio, which is approximately 1.61803398875. The ratio of two successive Fibonacci numbers tends to the Golden Ratio as n increases.

```python
import math
```

Next, we will define a function for calculating the Golden Ratio using the `math.sqrt()` method.

```python
def golden_ratio():
    return (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2
```

Now, let's use the Golden Ratio to create a more efficient function for calculating Fibonacci numbers using the following formula:

F(n) = floor((phi^n - (1-phi)^n)/sqrt(5))

where phi is the Golden Ratio.

```python
def fibonacci_efficient(n):
    phi = golden_ratio()
    return round((phi**n - (-phi)**(-n)) / math.sqrt(5))
```

Finally, we can calculate the 14th Fibonacci number by calling this function and print the result.

```python
fib_14 = fibonacci_efficient(14)
print("The 14th Fibonacci number is:", fib_14)
```

You should see the output `The 14th Fibonacci number is: 377`.exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)
Code output:
The 14th Fibonacci number is: 377
