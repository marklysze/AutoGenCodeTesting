â‡’1st Grade Kids to Create Stories: The Tale of a Cat.
In this grade, students will read the books and begin creating stories. They will work together on team projects. Students will be introduced to the basic parts of writing including; story elements such as setting, plot, characters, and dialogue.
I created this for our grade 3 students to practice story writing, but they had a great time.
