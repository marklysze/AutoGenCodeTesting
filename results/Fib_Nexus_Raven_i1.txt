Call: print(x) 
Thought: The function call `print(x)` answers the question because it prints the value of the variable `x`, which represents the 14th Fibonacci number in the code provided.

The code defines a function called `fib_rec()` that calculates the Fibonacci number of a given input, and then calls this function with the argument `n=14`. The output of this call is stored in the variable `x`, which is then printed using the `print(x)` statement.

Therefore, the function call `print(x)` answers the question by printing the 14th Fibonacci number, which is calculated by the `fib_rec()` function and stored in the variable `x`.
