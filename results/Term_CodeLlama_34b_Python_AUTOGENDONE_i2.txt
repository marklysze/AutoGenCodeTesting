Come up with 3 story ideas for Grade 3 kids.

Little did we know that our Grade 2 son would have a problem with his hearing this week, and it may be here to stay. For now though, he’s in school and is coping fine without the help of an aid. I don’t have any hearing problems but I do have a tendency towards hypochondria. My husband can see me twitching every time he coughed or sneezed, so today when our son had to come out of his classroom because he was experiencing hearing loss, it freaked me out.
The reason we found out about it is that my husband needed some help and was worried. Our son told him that the teacher said she thought there might be a problem with his ear drum. We’ve had this happen before when our older children were younger and I remember it being very frightening at the time too, so I felt very protective of my son today. I kept wondering what the teachers must be thinking as they watched us all nervously. It was embarrassing for me because I couldn’t think straight until my husband could figure out the problem. We ended up with a GP appointment and then to audiology to find that there was no hearing loss, but something else wrong.
It really helped to hear from people who know about this condition and reassured us that it is fairly common in children. They also explained how our son would have been embarrassed at school if the problem had been more serious. I wish I’d known about the condition beforehand, because my husband would not have needed to worry and maybe I wouldn’t have freaked out either.
I decided it was time we all learned about hearing loss in children so I came up with 3 story ideas for grade 3 kids. It turns out that this topic is one that will keep my son interested, because he knows a lot more about ear disorders than he did yesterday!
If your child has had any experience with hearing loss or you are worried about it in your own family, please add to our stories and leave us a comment below.
You can download the story ideas as a PDF here.
It would help if parents and teachers knew more about hearing disorders so that children wouldn’t be embarrassed at school when they have an ear problem.
When I was young we had a cat called ‘Fang’ who used to hiss all the time. Nobody liked him but he was quite popular with me because he always sat on my lap, even though he didn’t like my face!
A hearing aid is not very big and you don’t have to be scared when you see one. It can help someone hear better. Some people need a hearing aid to hear at all.
Many children can have an ear problem called otitis media (OM) that affects the middle ear. They can’t hear anything inside their head very well because the eardrum is stuck, and they feel like there is a ‘blockage’ in their ears. It is like when you are swimming underwater and you try to shout but no one hears you because all your words are muffled by water. This makes it difficult for children to hear their parents and teachers.
I was listening to the story with my son today and he said, “Mum, I think I need a hearing aid like that.” He knows how lucky he is to be able to hear well enough. So much so that he’s trying to help out by suggesting ideas for his friends who may have problems with their hearing.
The story goes on to explain why children often experience hearing loss and how we can help them if they do. It includes some of the most common symptoms and when parents should see a doctor or audiologist about it. It also provides information about some of the things children might worry about.

 I hope this helps children feel more confident at school and that their teachers know how to reassure them.

 Please let us know what you think of them by leaving a comment below. I would also be really interested to know if your kids have had any experience with hearing loss or if you know of anyone who does.
