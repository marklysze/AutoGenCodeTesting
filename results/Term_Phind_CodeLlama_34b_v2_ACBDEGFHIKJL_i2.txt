1. "The Secret of Dragon Cave" - A mysterious dragon's cave is discovered in the forest behind the protagonist's school. The dragon, who was believed to be extinct, turns out to be a gentle creature that loves playing with colorful balls. The story follows the children as they befriend the dragon and help it find its way back to the sunlight after being trapped in the cave for centuries due to a curse. Along the way, they learn valuable life lessons about teamwork, empathy, and bravery.

2. "The Time Travelling Pets" - The story revolves around three best friends from Grade 3 who find a magical clock in their attic. When they wind it, they are transported back to the days of dinosaurs. They become friends with a plucky triceratops named Trisha and together they must save her family and their village from a rampaging T-Rex. Along the way, they learn about the importance of family, loyalty, and working together to solve problems.

3. "The Space Explorer's Club" - A club for children who are interested in space exploration is opened at school. The main characters become members and embark on thrilling adventures through a portal they discover in the school's gym. They find themselves on an alien planet where they must work together to fix a malfunctioning spaceship, escape from hostile creatures, and figure out how to get back home before their parents notice they are missing. The story teaches them valuable lessons about responsibility, leadership, and overcoming fears in order to achieve their goals.
