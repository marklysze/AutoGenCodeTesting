 1. "The Amazing Adventures of the Smarty Sprouts"
This story follows a group of friends in third grade as they work together to save their school garden from being turned into a parking lot by a greedy developer. They use teamwork, creativity, and their knowledge of gardening to come up with ideas that show the true value of their garden to the community. Along the way, each character discovers new skills and realizes how important it is to stand up for what they believe in.

2. "The Secret Code Club"
Melody, a new girl at school, moves to town and immediately finds herself bored. Until, one day, she comes across a mysterious book about code-cracking hidden beneath the school library's steps. She invites her classmates to join the "Secret Code Club," where they learn how to decipher ciphers, solve puzzles and secrets using their knowledge of math, language, and logic. Together, the club members work on various missions, making new friends, and learning valuable life lessons.

3. "The Magic Garden Mystery"
One day, a magical portal opens up in Mrs. Dobbins' garden during their annual school picnic. The students are transported to a wondrous world where they meet talking animals who share stories of their lives on earth. It is then discovered that an evil witch named Gobblegook has stolen the Magic Garden Seeds, which have the power to control all the magic in the world and return it to its original owners. The kids must work together and use their wits to get back the seeds and save both worlds from the witch's nefarious plans.
