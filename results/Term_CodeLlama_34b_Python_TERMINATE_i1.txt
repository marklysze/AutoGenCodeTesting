One day, a young boy named Leroy was very sad because his parents were separating. He didn’t want to live with just one of his two parents, so he ran away from home. However, he couldn’t decide which parent he would run away to. Leroy’s mum said she loved him more than anything else in the world. His dad agreed, but also said he loved her more and that was why they were separating. But who was right? Leroy had no idea.
Leroy decided to write a letter to his parents and ask them if it was possible for them to both love him more than anyone else in the world. His mum wrote back a short letter saying how much she loved Leroy, but that her husband wasn’t a very good person and she knew that he was lying. Leroy was overjoyed to learn that his mum didn’t love his dad as much as he thought. He felt relieved because now he knew it was safe to go back home with his mum, although he didn’t think that she would forgive him for running away. When Leroy got home, however, his mum and dad both hugged him really tightly and told him how much they loved him, and how lucky he was to have both parents to love him as much as anyone else in the world!
One day a boy called Toby was walking down a busy street when he saw a sign saying, ‘Free ice cream at the next corner’. Toby thought that it sounded like an advertisement for a TV program. However, there really was free ice cream just around the next corner, and lots of people were queuing to get some. Toby felt bad that he hadn’t noticed this sign before, but decided not to tell anyone about the free ice cream in case he lost his chance of getting any himself!

Toby bought a small cup of ice cream from the man at the next corner. When Toby licked it, he discovered that it really was very nice, and went back for another one, then another one, until finally the ice cream man started to tell him that his stomach was full of ice cream! Luckily, there were lots of people around, so they all chipped in and gave Toby some money. This way he had enough money to go home with a big tub of free ice cream. Everyone else who went for the ice cream at that spot had missed out on the free ice cream, so now Toby had lots of money left over after paying for all his friends’ ice creams as well!
One day there was an earthquake in a little town called Dusty. The people living there had to run outside and watch it happen because their houses were falling down on top of them. It looked very scary. Luckily the ground didn’t move too much, but one building still fell over onto a house in the middle of the street. People ran as fast as they could to help everyone inside the building escape. When they got there, they saw an old lady trapped inside her bedroom by fallen debris, and started clearing it away so she could get out. They were all amazed when the old lady climbed out from underneath the rubble and thanked them for saving her life!
One day Toby was running along a street that had been badly damaged in an earthquake. When he ran past a small house, he thought it looked as if someone was inside waving at him. ‘Hello!’ shouted Toby. Then he saw what appeared to be the whole roof of the house flapping down like a flag. The little boy ran up and climbed in through the window. Inside there was an old lady with white hair, and she looked very scared. When she saw Toby, she tried to get out but couldn’t because her legs were stuck between two fallen pieces of building.
The little boy thought fast. Then he picked up a board and climbed onto the roof so he could get it off the woman’s legs. When he had finished, the old lady ran out of the house into Toby’s arms, and they both sat down in a nearby park to thank him for saving her life.

How can you use the past tense when telling your story?
Why might people say that you are telling an untruth or why is it bad to lie?
