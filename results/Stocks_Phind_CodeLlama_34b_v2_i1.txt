code_writer (to code_executor_agent):

Before proceeding with the task, please note that I cannot execute any code or perform tasks which require internet access, file operations, or external APIs. However, I can guide you on how to approach this task using Python and relevant libraries such as pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib.

First, let's import necessary packages:
```python
import yfinance as yf
import datetime as dt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
Next, we will download the stock data for TSLA (Tesla) and META (Meta Platforms), starting from the beginning of this year until now:
```python
start_date = dt.datetime(2024, 1, 1)
end_date = dt.datetime.now()

# Download stock data
tesla_data = yf.download("TSLA", start=start_date, end=end_date)
meta_data = yf.download("META", start=start_date, end=end_date)
```
Now we can plot the stock prices using matplotlib:
```python
# Create a figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot TSLA's closing prices
ax.plot(tesla_data.index, tesla_data['Close'], label='TSLA')

# Plot META's closing prices
ax.plot(meta_data.index, meta_data['Close'], label='META')

# Set title and labels
ax.set_title("Year to Date Stock Prices: TSLA and META")
ax.set_xlabel('Date')
ax.set_ylabel('Closing Price')

# Add a legend 
ax.legend()

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```
This code will download the stock data for TSLA and META from Yahoo Finance, and then plot their closing prices year to date.
