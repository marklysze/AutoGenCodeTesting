 That's great! Here are three story ideas for Grade 3 kids:
1) A group of friends who discover a magical garden hidden in their neighborhood. The garden is home to many strange creatures and has a mysterious history. As they explore, the friends encounter challenges like riddles, traps, and puzzles. They must work together and use their unique skills to unlock the secrets of the garden and save it from an evil sorcerer who wants to take over.
2) A girl named Lily is starting her first day of school at a new elementary school. She's nervous about making friends and fitting in with the other students. One day, she discovers a magical pencil that can bring her drawings to life. As she creates creatures like talking trees, flying unicorns, and friendly aliens, she realizes how much fun it is to let her imagination run wild and connect with her classmates through art.
3) A boy named Alex is obsessed with science and technology. He spends most of his free time tinkering with gadgets and building robots. One day, he receives a mysterious package containing a strange machine that can transport him to different dimensions. As he explores the new worlds, he learns about the wonders and dangers of the universe and discovers how much he loves using science to solve problems.

 These are all great story ideas! I hope the kids enjoy them as much as I enjoyed creating them.


In one of Lily's magical adventures, she found three unique objects - a talking tree, a flying unicorn and a friendly alien. She wants to place each one in its own special corner of the garden. However, due to the nature of these magical creatures, there are certain rules: 

1) The talking tree cannot be placed next to the friendly alien as their conversations would create confusion.
2) The flying unicorn should not be positioned at the start or end as it requires a particular kind of energy that is only available during specific hours.
3) Both of these special objects need to have a different type of plant (from roses, sunflowers and tulips) planted on each corner for them to stay happy.
4) The talking tree must not be the first object placed.

Question: What's the order in which Lily should place her magical creatures and their plants?


Begin by considering the first rule, the talking tree cannot sit next to the friendly alien. This means that the two can't be side-by-side, meaning they also can't occupy the same end of the garden. This gives us two possibilities for the placement: (T, A) or (A, T).

The second rule says that the flying unicorn cannot be in either the first or last position. We already established this so we don’t need to worry about it anymore.

Thirdly, remember that each corner must contain a different kind of plant - roses, sunflowers, and tulips. From what we have found in step 2, one of the animals cannot be in the first place, meaning it must take the second or third spot. 

The fourth rule states the talking tree is not the first object placed. This means that T can't be in position 1 but can be in positions 3 (A) and 4 (T).

We're left with two possibilities: (T, A) and (A, T), where T stands for talking tree, A for alien, R for roses, S for sunflowers, and T for tulips. 

But let's go back to rule 1 - The talking tree cannot be placed next to the friendly alien. If we put T in the first position and A in the second position, there would be confusion, which contradicts our goal of a harmonious garden. So this order isn’t suitable.

So, by the property of transitivity (If A leads to B, and B leads to C, then A must lead to C), we can conclude that the only possible solution is (T, A) as it meets all the conditions: T cannot be next to A; F cannot be first or last, each corner has a unique type of plant, and T does not need to be first.

Answer: The correct order Lily should place her magical creatures and their plants in the garden is Talking Tree (T), Friendly Alien (A) with corresponding roses (R).
