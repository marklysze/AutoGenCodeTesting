1. **The Mystery of the Lost Puppy**:
   - A young girl named Lily and her friend Alex find a lost puppy in the park while they are out riding their bikes.
   - The puppy is wearing a collar with a note that says, "Please take care of me until you find my family!"
   - Lily and Alex decide to look for the puppy's owners, but as they search, they realize there's more to this mystery than meets the eye.
   - Along the way, they encounter a series of clues that lead them to believe the puppy might belong to a famous local scientist who has been doing experiments on communication between animals and humans.
   - Lily and Alex must decipher the clues, avoid some bumbling thieves who are also interested in the puppy (thinking there's something valuable hidden with it), and ultimately reunite the puppy with its rightful owner, learning about science and friendship along the way.

2. **The Magical Mischief of Marigold**:
   - Marigold is a young witch-in-training who is always getting into mischief due to her lack of control over her spells.
   - One night, while trying to brew a simple potion to help her sleep, she accidentally casts a spell that turns her cat into a human boy!
   - The next morning, Marigold discovers the mess she's made and must find a way to reverse the spell before the sun sets, or the transformation will be permanent.
   - Along with her new human-cat friend, who can talk now but still acts like a cat, they embark on a series of adventures throughout the magical world, encountering other creatures and learning about magic and friendship.
   - Marigold must solve riddles, overcome obstacles, and learn the true value of responsibility to find the ingredients she needs to reverse the spell.

3. **The Adventures of Samurai Jack and the Time-Travelling Treehouse**:
   - Samurai Jack is a young boy who loves exploring the woods behind his house. One day, he discovers an old treehouse that seems to have appeared out of nowhere.
   - When he climbs inside, he finds a mysterious book that whisks him away on an adventure through time.
   - Each chapter sends Samurai Jack and his new talking fox companion, Sora, to a different historical period or famous location in history.
   - They meet famous figures like Leonardo da Vinci, Cleopatra, and Abraham Lincoln, and learn about science, art, history, and the importance of being brave and curious.
   - Samurai Jack must use his wits and courage to complete challenges that will allow him to return home while also ensuring that he doesn't disrupt the course of history.

These stories are designed to engage Grade 3 readers with exciting adventures that also teach them about various subjects such as science, history, responsibility, and friendship.
