Write Python code to calculate the 14th Fibonacci number.

Sure! Here's how you can calculate the 14th Fibonacci number in Python:
```python
x = 0
y = 1

for i in range(2, 15):
    z = x + y
    x = y
    y = z
    
print(y)
```

The code defines a for loop that starts at 2 (since the first two Fibonacci numbers are both 1) and runs until 14. Inside the loop, it calculates the next Fibonacci number by adding the current two numbers together, then updates `x` and `y` accordingly. Finally, it prints out the 14th Fibonacci number, which should be 89.
