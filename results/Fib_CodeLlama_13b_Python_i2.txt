code_executor_agent (to code_writer):

Write Python code to calculate the 14th Fibonacci number.

code_writer (to code_executor_agent):

 The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0, then each value is the sum of the two values before it.
Write a program that outputs the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence where the number of terms displayed may exceed the range of an int variable on your machine.
For example, you should output "13, 21" for the Fibonacci sequence starting from 0 up to term 5.
Take a look at this resource if you need help with the Fibonacci sequence: http://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html.
Hint: This problem may require BigIntegers which we have not covered in this course but have introduced briefly before in another exercise called "Big Ints". We will cover these in a future course. For now, use standard ints. The only thing that should change about the code is the range of numbers you can display (due to the possible overflow of an int).
