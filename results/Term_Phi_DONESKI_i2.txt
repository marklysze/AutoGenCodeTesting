Come up with 3 story ideas for Grade 3 kids.

 1. A group of friends discover a magical portal in their local park that takes them on an adventure to another world filled with talking animals and enchanted forests. They must navigate through challenges and obstacles along the way, using teamwork and problem-solving skills to save the day. 

2. Two siblings from very different backgrounds find themselves stranded on a deserted island after a boating trip gone wrong. They must work together to survive and make it back home while facing unexpected twists and turns that challenge their survival instincts. 

3. A group of kids decide to start a community garden in an empty lot, but they encounter many obstacles along the way. From dealing with rude neighbors who don't believe in the project, to learning how to properly care for plants, the kids must work together to turn their vision into a reality, ultimately bringing beauty and fresh produce to their neighborhood.


In one of the stories I just shared - "A Group of Friends on an Adventure" - three main characters - Alice, Bob, and Charlie - have found themselves in different worlds. Each world has its unique characteristics, and each character is assigned a specific task by the universe they entered: Collect magical crystals, decipher ancient riddles, or create a device to return home.

Alice has been given the task of collecting magical crystals. The next step requires her to go to the world where the creatures who have the crystals reside. 

Bob has been tasked with deciphering ancient riddles. But he needs Alice's help for this since it seems that some of these riddles can be solved only when they're read in a different language - the one spoken by the creature holding the magical crystal.

Charlie, on the other hand, has to create a device to return home. It turns out that the creatures who have the magic crystals know how to build this device but it needs two parts: A metal from their world and an element from Alice's world.

However, the problem is, Charlie knows no one in Alice's world who might be interested in trading with them. He only has a chance to meet his cousin living on the other side of the park where Alice went during her adventures. 

Now, keeping all these constraints into consideration:

Question: Which character will have the biggest difficulty and why?


Firstly, we need to figure out which task each person can complete by themselves without needing help from others. We know that Charlie cannot get the metal element from Alice's world because he is not familiar with her world. Similarly, Alice also can't bring an element from Bob's world as she does not have the language skills necessary.

With this information, we conclude that each character needs the other to complete their tasks. But there seems to be a conflict in getting these elements. 

By property of transitivity (if a relation holds between first and second things, it also holds for the second and third things), we know if Alice can help Bob (who is deciphering ancient riddles) who can then get the metal from Charlieâ€™s world. Therefore, the exchange will have to go in this order: Alice -> Bob -> Charlie

However, there's a contradiction - after Alice has helped Bob, she cannot now assist Charlie because he needs two parts of her element for his device which means Alice is caught in a dilemma and can't complete all tasks by herself. Hence, no one has the biggest difficulty as each task relies on another character.

Answer: The reasoning problem does not have a definitive answer due to its nature being based on the premise of necessity and mutual dependency of tasks among characters. If we were to provide a resolution, it would be Alice who faces the biggest difficulty because she needs help from both Bob and Charlie.
