The code you provided successfully calculated the 14th Fibonacci number and printed it to the console. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. In this case, after 13 iterations (since we're looking for the 14th number and the first one is already given), you get the value 233, which is indeed the 14th Fibonacci number.

Here's a brief explanation of what happens in each iteration:

1. The variable `a` holds the current value of the Fibonacci sequence (which starts at 0 for the first iteration).
2. The variable `b` holds the previous value of the Fibonacci sequence (which starts at 1 for the first iteration).
3. In each iteration, a new variable `c` is used to calculate the next number in the sequence without overwriting the current values of `a` and `b`.
4. The variables `a` and `b` are then swapped with the newly calculated value (`c`) and the previous value of `b`, respectively.
5. After 13 iterations, the variable `a` holds the 14th Fibonacci number, which is printed to the console.

The output `233` confirms that the code worked as expected.
