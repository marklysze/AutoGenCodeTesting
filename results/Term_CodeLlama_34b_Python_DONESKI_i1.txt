1. A man who sells old stuff out of a cart. His dog comes along every day, and helps him. The dog is called ‘Dog’!
2. A young man who makes his living playing music at parties. His friends say he should have more fun.
3. A family of turtles in a lake that had been polluted by oil spill. They wanted to move but the pump was broken and they could not get it fixed.
4. An old lady whose house is always full of bills and she has to keep cutting them up so she can get some change for her bus fare to go visit the doctor.
