Comment: Please add the full traceback of the error message you are getting when running your script.

Answer: The error is most probably coming from a column that contains more than one string element on line 850, like: `1, 'test', 2,3`, whereas it should be `'test'`. You can check the exact line of code by setting an exception and printing the value of `data.loc[e.parsers.ParserError.pos,'TimeStamp']` inside the try catch block (you have to replace 'TimeStamp', if you are using another column)

Answer: There was a misformated data in one line which caused the error message. I removed it and the code worked without any issues.
