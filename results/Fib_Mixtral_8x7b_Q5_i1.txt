code_executor_agent (to code_writer):

Write Python code to calculate the 14th Fibonacci number.

code_writer (to code_executor_agent):

 First, let's import the `math` library which contains functions that we can use for mathematical operations.

```python
import math
```

Next, we will define a function called `fibonacci` that takes an integer argument `n` and calculates the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive approach.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a positive integer")
    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

Now, we can calculate the 14th Fibonacci number by calling the `fibonacci` function with an argument of 14.

```python
fib_14 = fibonacci(14)
print(f"The 14th Fibonacci number is {fib_14}")
```

The output of the above code block will be:
```
The 14th Fibonacci number is 377
```

 I apologize for the error in my previous response. It seems that there was an issue with the formatting of the output.

To calculate the 14th Fibonacci number, you can use the following code:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a positive integer")
    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 1, 1
        for _ in range(n-2):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

fib_14 = fibonacci(14)
print(f"The 14th Fibonacci number is {fib_14}")
```

When you run this code, the output will be:
```
The 14th Fibonacci number is 377
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

 I apologize for the confusion. It seems that there is still an issue with the formatting of the code output.

To calculate the 14th Fibonacci number using a recursive approach, you can use the following code:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a positive integer")
    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

fib_14 = fibonacci(14)
print(f"The 14th Fibonacci number is {fib_14}")
```

When you run this code, the output will be:
```
The 14th Fibonacci number is 377
```
Let me know if you have any further questions or issues.
