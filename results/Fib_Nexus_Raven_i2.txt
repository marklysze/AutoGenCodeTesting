Call: None 
Thought: The function call `None` does not return any value because it is not a valid function call in Python.

The reason for this is that the `None` object in Python represents the absence of any value, and cannot be used as an argument or returned value by itself.

To calculate the 14th Fibonacci number using the recursive formula, we need to define a function that takes an integer argument n and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number:
```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
We can then call this function with an integer argument of 14 to get the 14th Fibonacci number:
```python
fib(14)
```
This will output `377`.

Call: fib(14) 
Thought: The function call `fib(14)` is used to calculate the 14th Fibonacci number using the recursive formula. The function `fib` takes an integer argument n and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number. In this case, we are calling the function with an argument of 14, which will return the 14th Fibonacci number.

The reason for this is that the `fib` function is defined to calculate the Fibonacci numbers recursively using the formula:
```python
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
```
This means that if we want to find the nth Fibonacci number (where n > 0), we can call the function with an argument of `n` and it will return the corresponding Fibonacci number.

So, when we call `fib(14)`, it will calculate the 14th Fibonacci number using this formula:
```python
f(14) = f(13) + f(12)
= (f(12) + f(11)) + f(11)
= (f(11) + f(10)) + (f(10) + f(9))
...
```
This will continue until we reach the base case of the function, which is when `n = 0` or `n = 1`. The function will then return the corresponding Fibonacci number.

In this case, the output of the function call `fib(14)` will be the 14th Fibonacci number, which is 377.
