1. "The Time-Traveling Treehouse": This adventure follows the story of Sam and Lily, two Grade 3 friends who stumble upon a magical treehouse in their school's backyard. Each time they enter the treehouse, it whisks them away through various historical eras, such as ancient Egypt or Renaissance Italy. During each trip, they learn more about history while solving small mysteries and making new friendships with people from that time period.

2. "The Little Robot's Big Heart": This heartwarming tale tells the story of Max, a Grade 3 student who receives a new robot companion named Bolt for his birthday. While most students are envious of this futuristic gift, Max learns that Bolt has trouble fitting in due to his lack of social understanding and empathy skills. To help Bolt overcome these challenges, Max teaches him about emotions and the value of friendship. As a result, Bolt becomes an inspiring example for kids everywhere on how anyone can embrace their differences and find true connection with others.

3. "The Secret Garden Club": Grace and her friends discover an overgrown garden at school that was once lovingly tended by an elderly teacher who has now retired. Together, they decide to revive the neglected space and form a secret garden club. Throughout the story, the children learn about teamwork, responsibility, and the importance of nurturing new life as they breathe fresh life into their school's hidden gem. Along the way, they encounter various challenges, but through problem-solving and determination, they turn the garden into an enchanting paradise.
