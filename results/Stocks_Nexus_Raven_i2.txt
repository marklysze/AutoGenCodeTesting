Call: print(x) 
Thought: The `print` function will simply print the value of the variable `x`, which is not defined in the current scope. Therefore, when we call `print(x)`, it will print an error message indicating that `x` is not defined.

The question asks us to plot TSLA's and META's stock prices YTD using Python code in a stateful IPython kernel. The `plot` function can be used for this purpose, but we need to import the necessary libraries and define the data first.

Here is an example of how we can plot TSLA's and META's stock prices YTD using the `plot` function:
```python
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the stock symbols
TSLA = 'TSLA'
META = 'META'

# Get the stock prices for TSLA and META
data_TSLA = yf.download(TSLA, start='2024-03-01', end='2025-03-01')['Close']
data_META = yf.download(META, start='2024-03-01', end='2025-03-01')['Close']

# Plot the stock prices for TSLA and META
plt.plot(data_TSLA)
plt.plot(data_META)
```
This code will download the stock prices for TSLA and META from 2024-03-01 to 2025-03-01, and then plot the prices for both companies using a single plot.

Therefore, the `print` function is not necessary for this question. The `plot` function can be used directly to visualize the stock prices YTD for TSLA and META.
