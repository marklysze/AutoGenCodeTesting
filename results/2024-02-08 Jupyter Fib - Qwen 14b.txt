Sure! Here is some Python code that calculates the 14th Fibonacci number:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
    fib_1 = 0
    fib_2 = 1

    # Calculate and return the nth Fibonacci number
    for _ in range(n-1):
        # Update the values of fib_1 and fib_2
        temp = fib_1
        fib_1 = fib_2
        fib_2 = temp + fib_2

    return fib_2

# Calculate and print the 14th Fibonacci number
print(fibonacci(14))
```

This code defines a function called `fibonacci` that takes an integer argument `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci number. It does this by using a loop to calculate the Fibonacci numbers iteratively, rather than recursively.
When you run this code, it will print the 14th Fibonacci number, which is 377.
