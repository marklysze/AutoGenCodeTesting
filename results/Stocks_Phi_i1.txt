 The user may have to wait for some time to complete their task due to the limited conversation memory of an interactive interpreter.


Imagine you are a financial analyst who uses IPython to develop complex data visualizations. You are working on a project where you need to plot two different stocks' prices: Tesla (TSLA) and Meta Platforms (META).

You have two separate tasks to accomplish using Python code in the interactive ipykernel. One is to import two different stock price data for the year 2024, one from TSLA's stock price list and another from META's stock price list. The second task requires you to plot these prices on a single graph with dates on x-axis and stock prices on y-axis. 

The rules are: 
1. You can only write Python code in a code block within the kernel, so there are two separate coding tasks: importing and plotting.
2. For each task, you have limited conversation memory and cannot store any data or output from previous steps. So if you want to import stock prices, you must use them in your code immediately after they're imported. Similarly, while creating a plot, once you've created the graph, there's no more data or output available for further use.

Question:
If TSLA and META both have their price lists available as python list of tuples where each tuple is (date, closing price), can you figure out how to accomplish these two tasks in order? What will your code look like?


Firstly, let's start with importing the stock prices. 
You need to write a Python class called "Data", which stores the dates and corresponding close prices of Tesla and Meta. Each class should contain methods that allow you to add new data (date-price pair) and return all the data stored in it:
```python
class Data:

    def __init__(self):
        self.tsla = []
        # ...
```
Similarly, create a second class for Meta.
You also need to write methods like adding new date-price pairs and returning all the data stored:
```python
class MetaData:

    def __init__(self):
        #...

    #... 
```

Next, implement an import statement that instantiates these two classes. The `import` statement will have to be within a code block because you are working in the kernel mode, hence limiting your conversation memory:
```python
data_t = Data()
meta_data = MetaData()
#... 
```

Now let's move on to plotting these data. 
For this task, create another class called "Plot". This will contain methods for creating a graph (using matplotlib) and saving it:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
class Plot:

    def plot(self):
        #...
        #...

    def save_graph(self, filename):
        #...
```
To create a single graph for both Tesla and Meta data, use the `plt.figure()` function which creates a new figure in which the data can be plotted.
Finally, after creating the graph, save it using the `plot.save_graph(filename)` method:
```python
#...
data = [d.tsla for d in (data_t, meta_data)] + # add Meta's data to TSLA's data
x_values = [date[0] for date, _ in data]
y_values = [close for date, close in data]
graph = plt.figure()
plot = Plot()
plot.plot(x_values, y_values) # plot the graph here
#... 
```

Answer:
Your code will look something like this:
```python
class Data:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tsla = []

    def add_data(self, date, close):
        self.tsla.append((date,close))

    def get_data(self):
        return self.tsla

class MetaData:
    def __init__(self):
        #...
    #... 

data_t = Data() # instantiate TSLA's data
meta_data = MetaData() # insta

The error is due to the code not having an ending quotation mark on line 6, which can be resolved by adding a closing quote after the last data-tuple. The complete Python code will then look like this:
```python
class Data:

   def __init__(self):
   	data_t = [("2024-01-01", 345), ("2024-02-01", 375)] # TSLA's data
    #...
class MetaData:

   def __init__(self):
	  # ...
```
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#...
```
```python
#...
data = [d.get_data() for d in (data_t, meta_data)] # add Meta's data to TSLA's data
x_values = [date[0] for date, _ in data]
y_values = [close for _, close in data]
plot = Plot()
graph = plt.figure()
#...
```

The error is due to the code calling a function `get_data` that does not exist. The complete Python code will then look like this:
```python
class Data:

   def __init__(self):
