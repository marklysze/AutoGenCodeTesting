# Create a figure and axes objects.

ax1.set_xlabel("Date")
ax1.set_ylabel("TSLA Price (in USD)")

# Plot the Meta Price in red and set the y-axis to the meta price.
ax2 = ax1.twinx()

# Plot the Meta price in red.
ax2.plot(dates, meta_price, color='red')

fig.tight_layout() # For layout management.
plt.show()

 As for your second question, a list comprehension is a concise way of creating lists in Python. 
Here's an example that demonstrates how to use a list comprehension:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a new list with the squares of all numbers using a for loop
squares_with_for_loop = []
for num in numbers:
    square = num ** 2
    squares_with_for_loop.append(square)

# Create a new list with the same result, but using a list comprehension
squares_with_comprehension = [num ** 2 for num in numbers]

# Both lists should contain: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

I hope this helps!


In a recent project as an Image Processing Engineer, you have been tasked with implementing the above-discussed concepts. You are given a task to plot and visualize multiple images on a single figure with their respective metadata. The metadata includes date of image creation, file size (in KB), and number of color channels (rgb, grayscale) in the images.

Rules: 
1. Each image is represented as a dictionary that contains three keys: "name", "size_kb", and "color_channels".
2. The names must be unique and have no spaces or special characters.
3. Images created on different dates are stored in separate folders named '2024', '2025', '2026', etc. Each folder contains images from a specific date.
4. Use the matplotlib library for visualization, specifically for the axes of each image plot to contain information about date of creation, file size, and number of color channels.
5. Your solution should be efficient in terms of memory usage since you will have to deal with potentially hundreds of images. 

Given this information, how can you leverage stateful IPython kernels, list comprehension, and Python's string manipulation methods to perform this task effectively?


You'd first need to fetch the list of all files in each folder (i.e., '2024', '2025', etc.). Use the glob module in python that finds the names of the files that match a certain pattern. 

To ensure you do not have any duplicate images, you can use the Python's set data structure to store image names and then compare it with your list of fetched image paths to check if an image exists in more than one folder.

The next step is to process each image individually. You need to:
1) Parse the metadata from the images' file name to obtain date, size_kb, and color_channels. This can be accomplished by using Python's string manipulation methods like split().
2) Using a list comprehension, create a list of dictionaries that contain these processed metadata for each image. 

The last step involves creating matplotlib plots with the data obtained from step 3. You need to:
1) Use subplots to plot multiple images on the same figure.
2) In each subplot, use text-based labels to display date of creation, file size (in KB), and number of color channels. This can be done using Matplotlib's xlabel(), ylabel() and xticklabels() functions, among others.

Answer: Your code should include the logic explained in steps 1 - 5 along with error handling for missing metadata or any other exceptions. The key is to effectively combine Python's powerful built-in tools like lists, dictionaries, sets, file handling, string manipulation and libraries like matplotlib with stateful IPython kernels for an efficient and compact solution.
